# ArkProject
task is to build an Express.js server that uses the socket.io library for communicating events to the client.
Hello! thanks for taking a look at my project. 
please install all dependencies,
start the server with “npm start”.
Sadly due to time constraints (algorithms and data structures midterm and a bunch of assignments I was not able to make a test suite)
Thanks for the oppurtunity :)
